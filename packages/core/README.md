# ðŸ’¤ Somnolence Core â€” The typed REST API framework of your dreams

Somnolence is a simple framework for providing strongly typed inputs and outputs to your REST API. The best part is that users of your API don't need access to your source code to generate a type safe client. They can just use Somnolence CLI to generate one, automatically!

## TypeScript Core
This is the "core" package for TypeScript, which is used for the `@somnolence/node`, `@somnolence/bun`, and  `@somnolence/deno` (TBA) packages. There should be no reason you need to install this.
